# time-me

A _very_ simple timezone converter! 🪄✨🕐

## Overview

How many times has this happened to you?

👋 **coworker in another timezone:** Hi! Are you free to meet sometime today?

👍 **you:** Yeah! I'm free at 10:00 am.

🤔 **coworker:** *checks your slack profile for your timezone, and does the math*
